# Capstone-project-Chen
For my project i will be working on a multiplayer online connect 4 game potentially, that uses HTML/CSS and javascript for the client side of things. While on the
Server side it uses python flask and websockets, When it comes to creating the rooms, lobies, etc. Also have a database of records be stored every time a new player joins the lobby under certain pretenses, potentially using mySql, SQlite, or maybe mongodb even.
